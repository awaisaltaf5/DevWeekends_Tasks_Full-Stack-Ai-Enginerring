# 🚀 Getting Started

## Prerequisites

- Node.js v18+
- npm or yarn

---

## Installation

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/devhub.git
```

Navigate into the project

```bash
cd devhub
```

Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Run development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open:

```
http://localhost:5173
```

## Production Health Monitoring

DevHub is a frontend-only Vite application, so it does not expose a backend `/api/health` endpoint or use a database. The production health target is the deployed frontend URL:

```http
GET https://devhub-nu-five.vercel.app/
```

The [production health check workflow](.github/workflows/health-check.yml) runs an external HTTP check every two days and can also be started with GitHub Actions `workflow_dispatch`. It expects a successful HTTP response within 20 seconds and retries transient failures twice. No environment variable or secret is required.

To verify the scheduled check, open the repository's **Actions** tab, select **Production health check**, and inspect the latest run. Use **Run workflow** for an immediate check; a successful run confirms the deployed URL returned a 2xx response.
